1. ArrayList: 
	i. ArrayList class implements List interface and it is based on an Array data structure.
	ii. ArrayList is a resizable-array implementation of the List interface. 
	iii. It implements all optional list operations, and permits all elements, including null.

2. ArrayList vs Array:
	i. The limitation with array is that it has a fixed length 
	- so if it is full you cannot add any more elements to it, 
	- likewise if there are number of elements gets removed from it, 
	- the memory consumption would be the same as it doesnâ€™t shrink.
	ii. On the other hand ArrayList can dynamically grow and shrink after addition and removal of elements.
	iii. Apart from these benefits, ArrayList class enables us to use predefined methods of it which makes our task easy.
	
3. Create an ArrayList:
	i. ArrayList<String> strList = new ArrayList<>();
	ii. ArrayList<Integer> integerList = new ArrayList<>(); 
	
4. Add elements to ArrayList: 
	i. strList.add("a string");
	ii. integerList.add(19);
	iii. strList.add(3, "string in fourth position"); [ not replace. right side items will be shifted ]
	
5. Change an element in ArrayList: 
	i. strList.set(0, "will replace the first item");
	
6. Remove elements from ArrayList: 
	i. strList.remove("a string");
	ii. strList.remove(2); [ will remove the 3rd element ]
	
7. Get ArrayList length: 
	i. strList.size();
